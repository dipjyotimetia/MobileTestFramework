### Supported Platforms

Appium supports app automation across a variety of platforms, like iOS,Android, from any platform. Each
platform is supported by one or more "drivers", which know how to automate that particular platform. Choose a driver
below for specific information about how that driver works and how to set it up:

* Android
    * The [UiAutomator2 Driver](https://appium.io/docs/en/drivers/android-uiautomator2/)
* IOS
    * The [XCUITest](https://appium.io/docs/en/drivers/ios-xcuitest/)

### Why [Appium](https://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/intro/)?

* Appium is an Open source automation tool used for cross platform testing like native, hybrid and web applications on
  both the platforms IOS and Android. Its capability for testing all kinds of tools under one platform, makes it a
  multipurpose and convenient testing tool.Appium is called as a cross platform testing tool because it uses JSON wire
  protocol internally to interact with native apps of IOS and Android using Selenium Webdriver.
